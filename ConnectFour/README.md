# Connect Four
A classic two-player connection game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

# Rules
- Players alternate turns.
- On each turn, a player drops one disc into any column.
- The disc falls to the lowest available space in that column.
- The first player to connect four of their discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If the board fills up with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
